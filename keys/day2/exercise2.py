# Exercise 2: Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations.

num1 = 15
num2 = 4

sum_result = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num1 / num2
remainder = num1 % num2
squared = num1 ** 2

print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
print("Remainder:", remainder)
print("15 squared:", squared)
