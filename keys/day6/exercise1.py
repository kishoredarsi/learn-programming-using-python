# Exercise 1: Write a program to sum the first 10 integers.

# Initialize a variable to store the sum
# Use a for loop to iterate through the first 10 integers
# Add each integer to the sum variable
# Print the sum

sum_result = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum_result += i

print("Sum of the first 10 integers:", sum_result)
