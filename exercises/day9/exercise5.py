# Exercise 5: Create a dictionary of items and their prices, and find a specific item from the dictionary.

# Create a dictionary
# Hint: dictionary = {key: value}
# Store the items as key and prices as value
items = {
    'apple': 0.50,
    'banana': 0.30,
    'orange': 0.40,
    'grapes': 0.60
}

# Print the dictionary
print(items)

# Create a variable with an item
item = 'apple'

# Print the price of the item using the dictionary
