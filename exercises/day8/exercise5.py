# Exercise5: Write a program to find a standard deviation of list of integers.


# Hint: The standard deviation of a list of numbers is calculated as:
# 1. Calculate the mean of the list.
# 2. Calculate the squared differences between each number and the mean.
# 3. Sum the squared differences.
# 4. Divide the sum by the number of elements in the list.
# 5. Take the square root of the result.
